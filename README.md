# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. The user is prompted to enter a matrix in the form of a nested list.
2. The lu function performs LU decomposition with partial pivoting. ùëÉ Permutation
matrix (to reorder rows for numerical stability). ùêø Lower triangular matrix (with ones
on the diagonal). ùëà Upper triangular matrix.
3. The L and U matrices are printed to the console 
4. End of the program (ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
5. A square matrix representing coefficients of the linear equations. A column vector
representing the right-hand side of the equations.
6.  LU Factorization: lu_factor(A) performs an LU decomposition with partial pivoting,
returning: piv: A pivoting information array. 3.Solving Ax=b. lu_solve((lu, piv), b)
solves the equation efficiently using the LU decomposition. 4.End of the porgram.
